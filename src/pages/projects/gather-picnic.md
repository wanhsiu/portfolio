description: Created the concept and identity system for ***gather*** - a giant
  picnic event to welcome the spring season. It is inspired by Hanami Picnic
  during cherry blossom season in Japan. In translation means “cherry blossom
  viewing”. The identity consists of floral graphic elements, the name of the
  organization, and a grid that is used an organization principle.
