description: "***gather*** is a giant picnic event to welcome the spring season.
  It is inspired by Hanami Picnic during cherry blossom season in Japan. In
  translation means “cherry blossom viewing”. The identity consists of floral
  graphic elements, the name of the organization, and a grid that is used an
  organization principle. I created the an identity from the concept to the
  identity system."
