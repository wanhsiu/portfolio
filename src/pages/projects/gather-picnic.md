description: I created the concept and identity system for ***gather*** - a
  giant picnic event to welcome the spring season. It is inspired by Hanami
  Picnic during cherry blossom season in Japan. In translation means “cherry
  blossom viewing”. The identity consists of floral graphic elements, the name
  of the organization, and a grid that is used as an organizing principle.
